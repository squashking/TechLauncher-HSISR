Each team member is assigned 3 papers and needs to make at least one literature research report, therefore, the should be at least 7 reports as the 1st key deliverable in our project.
For the quality standard, each report should cover: 1) whether the model can achieve the final requirement: scale up the image in 2x; 2) the approach and innovation core idea; 3) the data processing strategy and the dataset format; 4) the code repository and structure; 5) the experimental performance shown in the paper and whether it can meet our needs.

For self-investigation, we also found other papers that might be valuable for our goal which are listed below:
22. BUSIFusion: Blind Unsupervised Single Image Fusion of Hyperspectral and RGB Images.
23. HIR-Diff: Unsupervised Hyperspectral Image Restoration Via Improved Diffusion Models.
