# TechLauncher-HSISR
This is the code repository for the TechLauncher project Hyperspectral Image Super-resolution.

The project's client comes from the Australian Plant Phenomics Facility (APPF). At present, APPF has three hyperspectral cameras from different brands, each with its own unique working wavelength range. The project aims to increase the spatial resolution of the images captured by the HSI cameras by a factor of 2 or more. The resulting super-resolution hyperspectral images will facilitate more precise subsequent computer vision tasks, including object segmentation, classification, detection, and tissue or component analysis. The primary measure of success will be the improvement in spatial resolution while maintaining spectral fidelity.
